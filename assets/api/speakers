	"bio": "Steven is focussing on Mobile Technologies and Android in particular since his work on a platform-independent framework for mobile healthcare device integration from 2010 to 2012 for the German Aerospace Center (DLR). After leaving the DLR and while finishing his Master’s degree in Computer Science in Berlin he started to work as a freelance Android developer both working in existing teams and creating apps from scratch on the behalf of customers. In 2014 he founded the company Smart As Apps UG. Starting initially alone he’s now on his way to expand the company in order to deliver full-service Mobile and Web applications.\nWhile his main interests are within connecting devices and Android phones in order to create apps that actually benefit the health and well-being of users he is also interested in automated testing, tool-based code quality improvements, and software development processes in general.",
